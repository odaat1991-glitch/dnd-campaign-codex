Our story begins in the holy city of Elturel, a beacon of light and faith under the constant illumination of the Companion. The party gathered at the "Pair of Black Antlers" tavern, each with their own reasons for being in the city, unaware of the grim fate that was about to befall them.

Kriv the warlock was seeking knowledge about a fiendish pact. Elara the cleric was on a pilgrimage. And Gorok the barbarian... was looking for a good fight.

Suddenly, the sky darkened. The Companion, Elturel's second sun, turned black, shot through with veins of sickly green light. The ground trembled violently as massive chains erupted from the earth, hooking into the city's foundations. With a groan of stone and a collective scream of terror, the entire city of Elturel was ripped from the Material Plane and dragged down... down into the fiery depths of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells.
