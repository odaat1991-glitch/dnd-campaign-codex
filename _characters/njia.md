### Biography

Her tribe lived peacefully, living in the sacred forests, until greedy, rich buisnessmen from the city hired mercenaries to attack, so as to steal the lands for their capitalist endeavors. Much of her tribe was slaughtered, and the sacred White Wolf Talisman was stolen. While she fought bravely, she lost that fight. She now ventures from her home, in search of the lost taliman, and on a mission to eliminate all threats to the sacred forests and her people.

Home is Wood of Sharp teeth near Elturgard.
