### Backstory
Studied Sehanine Moonbow's Lunar Light teachings under the tutelage of High Priestess Felaern Dawraek at the temple of The Luminous Cloud on a small Isle off the coast of Snowdown. (Caer Westphal) Shipwrecked and separated from her parents at a young age she was rescued by the Clerics of the temple. Unbeknownst to her, her parents came from Caer Westphal. She feels a weird sense of once belonging to this town when she goes in for supplies for the temple. Raised under their teachings she took up her paladin oath to spread the light of the moon to the world of Faerun.
Bubbly attitude but stubborn in some aspects. Loves to help others and be of service. Still longs to figure out what happened to her parents. She still has dreams AND nightmares about that fateful moonlit night.
