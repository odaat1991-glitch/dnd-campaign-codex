### Biography

An exile from the shadowy depths of the Underdark, Seebo has traded the rigid matriarchy of Drow society for the arcane freedom of wizardry. He has adapted his people's natural grace and affinity for darkness to his magical craft. Unusually for a wizard, Seebo is a dervish in combat, weaving spells between the flashing strikes of a magical scimitar and dagger in a deadly dance of steel and sorcery.
